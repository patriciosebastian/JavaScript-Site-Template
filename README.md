# JavaScript-Site-Template
Template for JS Projects

This is a personal template I made to spin up certain JavaScript projects quickly. It is not perfect and a little rough.

Some links, pages, sections, etc. are optional. That will depend on what the project is. Even the design is optional.
If I wanted to keep some of the components/design aspects, I need to keep in mind that a couple things are not pixel perfect. Since these things are not essential, I purposely did not worry to make it pixel perfect.

My ultimate idea with this is to be able to get an idea going quickly and then question every part of it later.
